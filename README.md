# The Happy Alpaca

A client, an owner of an alpaca farm, commissioned you the project of designing
and developing a website to promote their farm online.

## General information

- You have 3 days to complete your project. Plan ahead and try to stay within this time frame,
  working from roughly 9 to 16
- the project will be done during class hours, so you'll always have a teacher
  support if necessary
- on Monday you'll have a chance to make a short 15 minute presentation of the project: explain how you managed the project (from planning to design to code), what went well and what you would like to improve next time. Also each one of you should state out what learning you personally took from the exercise.
- if for any reason you won't be able to finish the project on time, nothing to
  worry about: avoid working extra hours or during the weekend, unless your team
  really wants to
- it's not a competition, it's just a way to collaborate, practice and learn


## Instructions

Using the assets provided (wireframe, color palette, images), design a landing page to present to the client.

### Planning

- try to plan ahead as much as possible: before starting to work on the design
  or to code, try to come up with a reasonable schedule that fits the 3 days
  available
- divide the project in small and smaller tasks
- divide tasks between team members
- decide if you want to make your custom design first (on Figma, for example) or
  jump directly to code it and use a framework (Bootstrap, for example)
- nominate a project manager, if necessary: she/he will take care of the project
  status and internal organisation

### Design

- Use the wireframe below as a reference to create your own design for the website
- use the images from the `images` folder where necessary and according to your taste
- primary and accent colors, together with a set of grays, are provided

**IMPORTANT**: try to spend a maximum of about 2 hours on the design, you can always adjust
things later

#### Notes
- the wireframe serves only as a guideline, to give you an idea of the layout and where to put the content, but the actual design is completely up to you
- the client will not give you feedback on the design, just come up with something which you as a group think is appropriate
- be creative and feel free to experiment
- don't focus too much on the design so that you don't get stuck at the beginning, you can always refine and
  adjust things later

## Color system

There are 4 main colors to use in the project and from those colors a large set
of tings has been generated.

### Notes on colors

- use colors wisely: there are many available, but you don't have to use all
  of them, only what you need
- try to pair colors carefully: primary and accent colors are both very strong,
  so be careful to use them together. Try to rely on lighter tints when you have
  to combine more than one color
- for texts, you might try to use the main dark color, which is not a full
  black
- same for white, instead of a full white, might be good to use the light color
- if you don't like the colors provided, feel free to come up with your own

## Development

After having come up with some ideas for a design, implement them with HTML and
CSS. Use any of the things you've learned with no restriction. Feel free to use
Flexbox, Grid, Bootstrap (if you like it) or none of the above.

- Create and use one Git repository for the project, where the whole team
  collaborates
- try to use a mobile-first approach
- create a project boilerplate together as starting point for the tasks (HTML, CSS/SCSS file with general CSS e.g Reset CSS and Fonts) 
- as a team, try to discuss and adhere to some coding conventions for the project (e.g. SCSS or CSS, BEM, indendantion and so on)
- work on Git branches and Pull Requests as much as possible and keep the `main` branch clean and
  always with a working version
